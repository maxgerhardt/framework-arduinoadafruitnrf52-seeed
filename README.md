# Arduino Core for Seeed nRF52 Boards

This repository contains the Arduino BSP for Seeed nRF52 series:

- [Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-nRF52840-p-5201.html)
- [Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-Sense-nRF52840-p-5253.html)

## BSP Installation

There are two methods that you can use to install this BSP. We highly recommend the first option unless you wish to participate in active development of this codebase via GitHub.

### Recommended: Seeed nRF52 BSP via the Arduino Board Manager

 1. [Download and install the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (At least v1.6.12)
 2. Start the Arduino IDE
 3. Go into Preferences
 4. Add https://files.seeedstudio.com/arduino/package_seeeduino_boards_index.json as an 'Additional Board Manager URL'
 5. Restart the Arduino IDE
 6. Open the Boards Manager from the Tools -> Board menu and install 'Seeed nRF52 Boards'
 7. Once the BSP is installed, select 'Seeed XIAO nRF52840' from the Tools -> Board menu, which will update your system config to use the right compiler and settings for the nRF52.

### Optional (Core Development): Seeed nRF52 BSP via git

 1. Install BSP via Board Manager as above to install compiler & tools.
 2. Delete the core folder `nrf52` installed by Board Manager in Adruino15, depending on your OS. It could be
  * macOS  : `~/Library/Arduino15/packages/Seeeduino/hardware/nrf52`
  * Linux  : `~/.arduino15/packages/Seeeduino/hardware/nrf52`
  * Windows: `%APPDATA%\Local\Arduino15\packages\Seeeduino\hardware\nrf52`
 3. `cd <SKETCHBOOK>`, where `<SKETCHBOOK>` is your Arduino Sketch folder:
  * macOS  : `~/Documents/Arduino`
  * Linux  : `~/Arduino`
  * Windows: `~/Documents/Arduino`
 4. Create a folder named `hardware/Seeeduino`, if it does not exist, and change directories to it
 5. Clone this repo & its submodules:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino.git
   cd Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino
   git submodule update --init
   ```
   
 6. Restart the Arduino IDE
 7. Once the BSP is installed, select 'Seeed XIAO nRF52840' from the Tools -> Board menu, which will update your system config to use the right compiler and settings for the nRF52.

### Adafruit's nrfutil tools

[adafruit-nrfutil](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_nrfutil) (derived from Nordic [pc-nrfutil](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil)) is needed to upload sketch via serial port.

- For Windows and macOS, pre-built executable binaries are included in the BSP at `tools/adafruit-nrfutil/`. It should work out of the box.
- Linux user need to run follow command to install it from PyPi

```
$ pip3 install adafruit-nrfutil --user
```
